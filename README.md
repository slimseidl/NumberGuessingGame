This is a basic number guessing game with logic written in C++. A random number is generated between 1 and 100. The program prompts a user for an initial guess, then prompts the user to guess higher or lower until the correct answer is received. This works only in the terminal right now. In the future, I plan on using a gaming engine to create a user interface for this application.
